        <h2>Data we collect and store</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account & identifiers:</strong> We collect account information such as username, nickname and device tokens to be able to send and deliver nudges.</li>
          <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> Approved connections between accounts (who you've added/accepted).</li>
          <li><strong>Nudges:</strong> The nudge type you send/receive and timestamps (sender, recipient, sent time).</li>
          <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> We collect and store the account creation date and in-app profile information such as your level and accumulated XP points. If you choose to upload a profile photo, we store the image and related metadata (such as file size and format) to display it to your approved connections. Profile photos are optional and can be changed or deleted at any time. We store only the currently active profile photo. When you upload a new photo or delete your profile photo, the previously stored image is deleted from our servers as part of normal operation. In limited cases, deletion may be delayed due to technical or operational reasons (such as retries or system maintenance), but we do not intentionally retain prior profile photos beyond what is necessary to operate the Service.</li>
