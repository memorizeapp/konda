        <h2>9. Account Termination</h2>
        <h3>9.1 Termination by You</h3>
        <p>You may delete your account at any time through the Settings section of the App. When you delete your account:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All your data will be permanently deleted from our servers (including account information, contacts, and nudge history)</li>
          <li>We will attempt to delete all your CloudKit data (nudge history, groups, and favorites stored in your iCloud)</li>
          <li>Your username will become available for reuse by other users</li>
          <li>Your contacts will no longer see you in their inbox</li>
          <li>This action cannot be undone</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Account deletion requires an active internet connection. If you attempt to delete your account while offline, the deletion will fail and you will need to try again when you have an internet connection. Your account and data will remain intact until the deletion process successfully completes on our servers.</li>
          <li>While we attempt to delete all CloudKit data from your iCloud account, deletion of CloudKit records is subject to Apple's CloudKit service limitations and may not always complete successfully. Some CloudKit data may remain in your iCloud account if deletion fails due to network issues, CloudKit service errors, or other technical limitations. However, you will no longer be able to access this data through the App after account deletion.</li>
          <li>If you wish to ensure all iCloud data is removed, you can manually delete the app's iCloud data through your Apple device settings: Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Storage → [App Name] → Delete Data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.2 Termination by Us</h3>

          <li>Violation of these Terms</li>
          <li>Illegal activity</li>
          <li>Fraudulent or harmful behavior</li>
          <li>Any other reason we deem necessary to protect the Service or other users</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>9.3 Effect of Termination</h3>
        <p>Upon termination:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>All data associated with your account will be deleted as described above</li>
